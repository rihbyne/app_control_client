app_control_client
==================
This project implementation was inspired from Internet of Things (IoT)
concept. It makes use of embedded system, Raspberry pi. The request routing logic is
written on top of middleware framework and deployed on application server running on
embedded device. This is exposed as REST like web service and further integrated
into a web app. The other part of this project used a voice recognition API to control
GPIO of raspberry Pi.
